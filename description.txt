Creating a complete React application based on the provided instructions requires a significant amount of code and structure. Below, I will outline a simplified version of how you might implement a React application based on Figma designs, focusing on the key aspects mentioned in your request. This will include component breakdown, responsiveness, interactivity, and code quality.


Project Overview
This project involves creating a responsive React application based on provided Figma designs. The application will feature a clean and modern UI, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy and adherence to design specifications. The main goal is to implement all visual elements, layouts, and styles as specified in the Figma designs while also adding functionality to open a third pane with a click. The application will be structured using reusable components, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

Key Features
Responsive Design: The application will be designed to work seamlessly across various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Component-Based Architecture: The UI will be broken down into reusable React components, promoting code reusability and easier maintenance.

Interactive Elements: The application will include interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and lists, with appropriate state management and API calls.

Error Handling: Proper error handling will be implemented to manage user interactions and API responses gracefully.

Documentation: The code will be well-documented, with clear descriptions of component hierarchies, props, and functionality.




Component Breakdown
App: The main component that holds the application state and renders the header, sidebar, main content, and third pane.

Props: None
State: isThirdPaneOpen (boolean)
Header: Displays the application title and a button to toggle the third pane.

Props: toggleThirdPane (function)
Sidebar: Contains navigation links or other relevant information.
